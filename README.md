# DeltaX BootCamp ðŸš€

This repository contains my learning journey from the **DeltaX BootCamp**, where I completed courses on:

- **Git**: Version control, branching, merging, and collaboration.
- **C#**: Object-oriented programming, .NET basics, and application development.
- **SQL**: Database management, queries, and relational database design.

This repo includes notes, exercises, and projects from the bootcamp. ðŸ“šâœ¨
